# Golang Tweet-thing

This is a small tool to interact with the Twitter API via the command line.  It is inspired by the [Ruby Twitter CLI](https://github.com/sferik/t).

# How to use

There's only one command so far: `delete`. This will delete all Tweets and Retweets from your timeline. This was the first use-case of the tool and it works well. You will need to do some setup for it to work, though.

## Setup
(instructions copied from [`sferik/t`'s README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sferik/t/master/README.md))

> Twitter API v1.1 requires OAuth for all of its functionality, so you'll need a registered Twitter application. If you've never registered a Twitter application before, it's easy! Just sign-in using your Twitter account and then fill out the short form at <https://apps.twitter.com/app/new>. If you've previously registered a Twitter application, it should be listed at <https://apps.twitter.com/>. Once you've registered an application, make sure to set your application's Access Level to "Read, Write and Access direct messages", otherwise you'll receive an error that looks like this:
>
>    Error processing your OAuth request: Read-only application cannot POST
>
>A mobile phone number must be associated with your account in order to obtain write privileges. If your carrier is not supported by Twitter and you are unable to add a number, contact Twitter using <https://support.twitter.com/forms/platform>, selecting the last checkbox. Some users have reported success adding their number using the mobile site, <https://mobile.twitter.com/settings>, which seems to bypass the carrier check at the moment.

## Running commands

When running the command you'll need to either pass a lot of parameters on the command line (which you can see by running `gt delete -h`) or you can set up a `.gtrc` file in your `${HOME}` directory.  You can look at the [example .gtrc](example-gtrc) file to see what needs to go in there.
